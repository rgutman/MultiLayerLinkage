# MultiLayerLinkage
Code for simulations and simulated data analysis from the paper A Bayesian Multi-Layered Record Linkage Procedure to Analyze Functional Status of Medicare Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury. 

DiscreteSimulations folder contain the code when assuming that the comparison function for the Income-Level variable is that the variables represent the same entry when the difference is smaller than 500, and 0 otherwise.

ContinuousSimulations folder contain the code when assuming that the comparison function for the Income-Level variable is the Euclidean Distance.
