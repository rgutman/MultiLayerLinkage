# MultiLayerLinkage
Code for simulations and simulated data analysis from the paper A Bayesian Multi-Layered Record Linkage Procedure to Analyze Functional Status of Medicare Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury. 

**DiscreteSimulations folder** contains the code when assuming that the comparison function for the Income-Level variable is that the variables represent the same entry when the difference is smaller than 500, and 0 otherwise.

**ContinuousSimulations folder** contains the code when assuming that the comparison function for the Income-Level variable is the Euclidean Distance.

**GraphGeneration folder** recreates the heatmap that is provided in the paper
